# Diabetes Classification in patients
Diabetes is a chronic health condition that occurs when the body is unable to effectively process glucose, leading to elevated blood sugar levels. With rising obesity rates and lifestyle changes, diabetes has become a significant public health challenge worldwide. Early detection and management of diabetes are crucial for reducing complications and improving patient outcomes.

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the presence of diabetes in individuals based on several health-related factors. By leveraging data-driven insights, the goal is to create a classification tool that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying at-risk patients, enabling timely interventions and lifestyle modifications.

## Overview
The **Diabetes Classification Project** utilizes the **Daiabetes prediction dataset from Kaggle*, which consists of various health measurements collected from patients. The dataset includes features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and age, alongside the target variable indicating whether the patient has diabetes (0 for no, 1 for yes).

### Methodology
The project follows a structured methodology, which includes the following steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Utilizing the Diabetes Dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions, relationships, and potential patterns.
4. **Model Development**: Implementing and training multiple machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest Classifier.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics and validating results.
